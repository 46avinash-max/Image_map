</font>
</h3>
<hr size="3" color="green">
<p align="center">
<font face="Georgia" size="5">Panjappur (also spelled Panjapur) is a suburb in the Edamalaipatti Pudur area, part of the Tiruchirappalli city limits.
It lies along the Tiruchi-Madurai National Highway, giving it strategic importance for transport and connectivity. 
A major development there is the Muthamizh Arignar Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Integrated Bus Terminus (IBT), inaugurated in May 2025, at a cost of roughly ₹492-500 crore. 
This bus terminus handles both intra-city (city buses) and mofussil (long-distance/inter-district) bus services. 
It has many passenger amenities: numerous bus bays (for city and long distance), waiting lounges, restrooms & bathrooms, kiosk/shops, auto rickshaw bays, etc. 
The terminus is multi-level: the ground floor mostly for mofussil buses, the first floor for city buses. 
Panjappur is also host to educational institutions, for example Saranathan College of Engineering in the Venkateswara Nagar area. 
The area falls under a ward of the Trichy Corporation (Ward No. 39 and others), indicating it's officially part of the city governance area. 
Infrastructure improvements include new checkposts (for traffic control), better road access, etc., due to its growing importance as a transport node. 
Because of all these developments, Panjappur is fast evolving, playing a key role in decongesting older bus stands (like the Central Bus Stand) and improving transit flow in Trichy.</font>
